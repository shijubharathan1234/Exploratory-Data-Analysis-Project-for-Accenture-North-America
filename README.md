## Mission
To start our engagement with Social Buzz, we are running a 3 month initial project in order  
to prove to them that we are the best firm to work with. They are expecting the following:  
 - An audit of their big data practice
 - Recommendations for a successful IPO
 - An analysis of their content categories that highlights the top 5 categories with the largest aggregate popularity 
## Process
 - Identify which datasets will be required to answer your business question - which is to to figure out the top 5 categories with the largest popularity.
 - Cleaning Data
     - removing rows that have values which are missing,
     - changing the data type of some values within a column, and
     - removing columns which are not relevant to this task
         - Think about how each column might be relevant to the business question you’re investigating. If you can’t think of why a column may be useful, it may not be worth including it.
